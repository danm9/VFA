	<h1>Instructions</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>The variable function analysis performs a statistical test (Mann-Whitney U) on a given set of data.</p>
	<h2>Data Input</h2>
		<p>It is easiest to copy and paste data directly from excel, as it will input the tab characters for you</p>
		<p>The data must be in the form "VAR1 VAR2 VAR3 VALUE", where the gaps are TABS and each line ends in a value &gt; 0 but &lt; 1. 
			Each VAR can be anything, it could be single base pairs of a gene, e.g. "A C T G 0.4". 
			The VARs could also be amino acids, allele variants, etc. The VALUE must be the last thing on each line, and must be between 0 and 1. It is a measure
			of the function of that sequence of VARs as a whole.
		</p>
	<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>Say you are trying to determine if height makes a difference in running speed. Your variables you measure are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Weight</li>
			<li>Height</li>
			<li>Gender</li>
			<li>Age</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You did a low-budget study and measure function as a fixed distance over running time of the individual which is then normalized. 
			To avoid confusion, heights are prepended with 'h', weights with 'w', and ages with 'a'. Your data is as follows:
		</p>
		<table id="example_table">
		<th>Age</th>
		<th>Weight</th>
		<th>Gender</th>
		<th>Height</th>
		<th>Function = (Distance/run time)</th>
		<tr><td>a15</td><td>w100</td><td>Female</td><td>h150</td><td>0.9</td></tr>
		<tr><td>a15</td><td>w100</td><td>Female</td><td>h130</td><td>0.5</td></tr>
		<tr><td>a15</td><td>w100</td><td>Female</td><td>h100</td><td>0.2</td></tr>
		<tr><td>a15</td><td>w100</td><td>Female</td><td>h95</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
		<tr><td>a15</td><td>w100</td><td>Female</td><td>h140</td><td>0.8</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>You can copy and paste the table (not including the headers) into the text area and click submit to get medians, counts, and p-values that will 
			list each category and assign it a p-value based on whether or not the presence or absense of that variable makes a significant difference on the function
